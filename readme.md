# strugglebus - a really terrible journaling app
strugglebus is a journaling app that asks you of only one main thing per day: "what was today's struggles?" 

### How?
1. `python strugglebus.py`
2. Answers some questions
3. Done.

#### Why?
I've always been terrible at journaling, mostly because I find that I try to go too far in depth and write too much. This is my attempt to summarize my day by listing the biggest struggle I had that day. 

#### Roadmap
[] Build the application
[] Set up some form of analytics
[] Move to a webapp?
